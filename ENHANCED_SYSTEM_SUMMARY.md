- **Cross-Row-Caps**: Results stable from 100k to unlimited rows (continuity fixed!)
- **Risk Control**: No strategies exceeded 90% drawdown threshold

## 🔧 Technical Innovations

### 1. Regime-Aware Strategies
```cpp
// Hurst exponent for trend vs mean-reversion detection
double hurst = calculate_hurst_exponent(returns);
if (hurst > 0.55) regime = TRENDING;
else if (hurst < 0.45) regime = MEAN_REVERTING;
```

### 2. Dynamic Position Sizing
```cpp
// Kelly criterion with volatility targeting
double kelly_fraction = (win_rate * avg_win - (1-win_rate) * avg_loss) / avg_win;
double position_size = kelly_fraction * volatility_target / current_volatility;
```

### 3. Kalman Filtering for Adaptive Means
```cpp
// Real-time mean estimation with noise filtering
mean_estimate += kalman_gain * (new_price - mean_estimate);
error_covariance = (1 - kalman_gain) * predicted_error;
```
